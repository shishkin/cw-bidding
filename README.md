# CosmWasm Academy Final Exam

My take at the final exam for https://cosmwasm.getlearnworlds.com/.

Here goes the problem statement:

## Bidding platform

Create a smart contract for bidding procedure.
The project should be a public git repository created by yourself, send us the repository address.

At instantiation, user opens a bid for some offchain commodity. Bid will be happening using only single native token (for eg. `ATOM`). Contract owner is optionally provided by its creator - if missing, contract creator is considered its owner.

After contract is instantiated, any user other than the contract owner can raise his bid by sending tokens to the contract with the `bid {}` message.
When the message is called, part of the tokens send are immediately considered
bidding commission and should be transferred to contract owner.
It is up to you to figure out how to calculate commission.

The total bid of the user is considered to be a sum of all bids performed minus all the commissions.
When user raises his bid, it should success only if his total bid is the highest of all other users bids.
If it is less or the same as the highest, bidding should fail.

Owner can `close {}` the bidding at any time.
When the bidding is closed, address with the highest total bid is considered the bidding winner.
The whole bidding of his is transferred to the contract owner.

After the bidding is closed, everyone who bid and didn't win the bidding, can `retract {}` all his funds.
Additionally the `retract` message should have an optional friend receiver being an address where the sender biddings should be send.
So `retract {}` sends all senders bids (minus commissions) to his account.
The `retract { "receiver": "addr" }` should send all the sender bids to the `"addr"` account.

Additionally - all the information kept on the contract should be queryable in reasonable manner.
The most important queries are: the given addr total bid, the highest bid at the current time (who and how much), if the bidding is closed, who won the bid (if it is closed).

The contract should contain some tests using multitests framework, but I do not expect any particular coverage - 2-3 main flow tests should be enough.

## Example

There is the bidding created at `bidding_contract` address.
`alex` is sending `bid {}` message with 15 atoms.
The highest bid right now is 15 atoms by `alex`.
Now `ann` is sending `bid {}` message with 17 atoms.
The highest bid is 17 atoms by `ann`, and total bid by `alex` is 15 atoms.
Now `ann` is sending another `bid {}` message with 2 atoms.
Now the highest bid is 19 atoms by `ann`, and total of `alex` is 15 atoms.
Then `alex` sends `bid {}` message with 1 atom - this message fails, as it would leave `alex` at 16 atoms bid total, which is not the highest right now.
He has to send more than 5 atoms. `alex` sends another `bid {}` with 5 atoms.
It makes the highest bid being 20 atoms by `alex`, and `ann` has total of 19 atoms bid.
The `close {}` is send by contract owner - `alex` wins the bid, 20 atoms are send to bid owner from `bidding_contract`.
`ann` can claim her atoms back calling `retract {}` message, optionally putting a receiver field there to point where funds should be send back to.

## Hint

The [cw_storage_plus::Map<Key, Value>](https://docs.rs/cw-storage-plus/0.16.0/cw_storage_plus/struct.Map.html) utility would be a great tool to keep total bids.
